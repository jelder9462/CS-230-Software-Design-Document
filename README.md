# CS-230-Software-Design-Document

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The client was a web game developer that was looking to expand their web game to a handful of new platforms. They desired a web server being designed as well as client software for multiple platforms. 

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I think the thing that I did particularly well was being concise and specific with topics that were necessary to explain.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
By setting up a design document first, many of the concepts that were going to be utilized in the code got fleshed out and thought up before getting too far into the code itself. This effectively avoided investment bias, so that there's no need to spend time developing code and scrapping it later.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would revise the evaluation part of the document for two reasons. I would both reformat it so that it is more visually appealing, and I would reformulate some of the responses to be more specific. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
To implement the user's needs, I made sure to pay attention to the goals that they had set up as requirements for their software. For example, because they requested the ability to run their client software on multiple platforms, I made sure to vet what platforms were being targetted and ensured that the development tools that were going to be utilized were effective at targetting those platforms. It is important to consider the user's needs when designing the program, not only because it gets the client what they're looking for, but also prevents the need for rework later.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
My approach for designing software is to look through the needs of the software and figure out what sorts of functionality to utilize. Then, after the rough layout of the software was laid out, start the acutal programming. I think one way I would analyze and design similar software in the future would be to look at design patterns for similar code, especially ones that have functionality I require and model my methods off of that.
